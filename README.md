# edxCourse-1
Introduction course to HTML and Javascript.

This repository is created for the edx.org-Course on Introduction to HTML and Javascript.
I'll use this to share my hands-on trainings and homework, so i can work at home and at work.

At work i'll be using the Visual Studio Code, at home i'll be using Webstorm by JetBrains.
